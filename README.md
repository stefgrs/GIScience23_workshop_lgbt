Organisers: Dr Stef Garasto & Dr Jia Wang 
School of Computing & Mathematical Sciences, University of Greenwich

Format: half day

Technical equipment required 
None

## Call for Participation
This workshop brings together geospatial community, social scientists and anyone interested in tackling location-based inequalities faced by minority groups, particularly LGBT+ people. We aim to incorporate narratives from the lived experience of LGBT+ people, to identify key factors and highlight the nuances behind people’s choices, with large datasets (e.g., Census 2021 from the UK) that could help us measure the economic and social cost of where LGBT+ people live. The primary objective of this workshop is, therefore, to begin the development of a framework to represent the set of factors that shape LGBT+ people’s choices of where to live. We welcome contributions in any area related to the social and spatial inequality utilising GIS tools or Big Spatial Data, as well as research that reflects on and seeks to inform policymaking. The workshop will combine talks and group discussions and there is space for the agenda itself to be co-produced with participants.


## Programme and timeline

| Activity | Allocated time (minutes) |
| --- | ----------- |
| Introduction from the organisers | 5 |
| Participant introduction and short pitches: current research highlight and motivation to join the workshop. | 45 |
| Activity 1 – Identify influential factors and realise a conceptual framework. | 55 (30 + 25) | 
| Guided group discussions on framework’s factors: <li> •	Participants will be split into groups of 4-5. 
•	Using fictitious “personas” as a starting point, they will discuss potential factors that might impact on housing decision for each persona.
•	The personas used, while using LGBT+ experiences as the starting point, will incorporate a wide range of intersectional identities.
•	Factors will be written on post-it notes and collected for the next stage. 
Review and clustering of factors
•	Participants will join a plenary discussion to review the factors identified during the previous discussion.
•	Similar factors will be merged, missing factors will be identified and proposed. 
•	A complete set of factors will be classified, and their relationships will be identified (as an ontology). A conceptual framework will be proposed as the outcome of Activity 1. |  |
| Coffee break | 20 |
| Activity 2 – Identify available and missing datasets and suggest possible methods and tools for analysis and visualisation. | 55 |
| •	Regarding the factors from Activity 1, guided group discussion held on available and missing datasets. The factors identified above will be split across groups for discussion. •	Discussion on GIS methods and tools for missing data, data analytics, visualisation, and prediction in relation to the factors and their relationships. | |

Total duration = 3 hours
